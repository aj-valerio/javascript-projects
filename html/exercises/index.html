    <p>One day, I would love to build an app that would allow academics and others with substantial home libraries to manage their collections. My own spouse has an ever-expanding library and it would be really great to be able to check in an app and see information like: where is this book (home office? work office? lent out?) or purchased/received vs purchased/not yet received to prevent inadvertently ordering multiples.</p>
